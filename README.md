# AI-Based Cyber Security Threat Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI-Based Cyber Security Threat Detection** system is designed to identify and classify cyber threats using advanced machine learning techniques. As cyberattacks grow in sophistication and frequency, this project offers a proactive solution to detect potential intrusions, malware, phishing, and other malicious behaviors in real-time. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence and historical security data, the model helps improve detection accuracy and response time.

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   → Import publicly available threat datasets.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   → Clean missing values, normalize data, label encode categories.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   → Select top relevant features using correlation and statistical methods.

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   → Train ML models and evaluate them using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. **Threat Prediction**  
   → Input new data and predict threat type.

6. **Visualization**  
   → Visual charts for threat patterns, model performance, and alerts.
